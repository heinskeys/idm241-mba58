    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This project is a microinteraction design to improve the Steam Wishlist tile, created for IDM 241: Microinteraction Design under the guidance of Professor Jervis Thompson. Over 10 weeks, I brainstormed, designed, and developed three builds, each adding new interactions and refining the visual style. Steam's current interface offers minimal feedback, often limited to state changes like transitioning to a new page. My goal was to add subtle microinteractions that fit within Steam’s branding while making the interface more visually engaging and intuitive. The final build includes five integrated microinteractions, with detailed descriptions of their triggers, rules, feedback, and loops. This was a solo project with class and instructor support.</p>

    <h3>Context and Challenge</h3>

    <h3>Background / Description / Timeline / Purpose</h3>
    <p>Steam has a distinct branding style but lacks depth in microinteractions, such as hover effects or animations, to engage users beyond basic state changes. This project, developed over 10 weeks, focused on reimagining the Wishlist tile to be more visually interesting and user-friendly without compromising Steam’s established aesthetic or overwhelming the user.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>When interacting with Steam, users rarely encounter microinteractions—there is little feedback beyond state changes, such as visiting a new page. This creates a utilitarian but uninspired experience. I aimed to redesign the Wishlist tile by adding subtle, brand-aligned animations and interactions to improve usability and visual appeal.</p>

    <h3>Goals & Objectives</h3>
    <p>1. Redesign the Wishlist tile with microinteractions that align with Steam’s branding.</p>
    <p>2. Make interactions engaging but seamless and nonintrusive.</p>
    <p>3. Ensure consistency across all interactions within the tile.</p>
    <p>This was a solo project, allowing me to explore coding techniques and develop a unique solution while adhering to Steam's rigid brand style.</p>

    <h3>Process and Insight</h3>

    <h3>Research and Ideation</h3>
    <p>I began by focusing on Steam’s branding to ensure my changes felt authentic and well-integrated. Steam’s user base values functionality, so I wanted to avoid overcomplicating interactions. My process centered on identifying where subtle changes, like hover effects or animations, could enhance usability without detracting from the platform's simplicity.</p>

    <h3>Design and Development</h3>
    <p><strong>1. Initial Build (Alpha)</strong><br>
    Focused on replicating Steam’s interface, particularly its rigid sizing and layout conventions. Explored subtle hover animations and state transitions as initial concepts.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Midway Build (Beta)</strong><br>
    Introduced gradient loops, button scaling, and enhanced tooltips. Addressed challenges in recreating Steam’s modal system, balancing flexibility with accurate sizing.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Final Build</strong><br>
    Created a cohesive interaction ecosystem. Used Grid layout for precise alignment, ensuring flexibility and adherence to Steam’s hierarchy. Finalized five key microinteractions to bring the Wishlist tile to life.</p>

    <h3>Key Microinteractions</h3>
    <p><strong>Add-to-Cart Button:</strong> On hover, a gradient loop plays continuously until the button is pressed, scaling up and down for feedback.</p>
    <p><strong>Pop-Up Modal:</strong> The modal now animates upward when triggered, with gradient loops and scaling effects on buttons.</p>
    <p><strong>Game Ratings Tooltip:</strong> Enhanced Steam’s unique rating system by color-coding the text and darkening the tooltip background for better visibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Tags:</strong> Steam’s robust tagging system now features hover effects that include text scaling, color changes, and dynamic feedback.</p>
    <p><strong>Seamless Transitions:</strong> Ensured all interactions maintained a consistent, unified design language.</p>

    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>The final Wishlist tile design features microinteractions that integrate seamlessly into Steam’s interface, balancing subtle feedback with brand authenticity. By enhancing visual elements like buttons, tooltips, and tags, the redesign creates a more interactive experience while respecting Steam’s core aesthetic.</p>
    <p>Specific features include:</p>
    <p>1. Dynamic Visual Feedback: Gradient animations, color changes, and scaling effects.</p>
    <p>2. Interactive Tooltips: Enhanced readability and visibility of Steam’s unique rating system.</p>
    <p>3. Consistency Across Elements: Unified styles across buttons, pop-ups, and hover states to ensure a cohesive user experience.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>The final project meets the goal of creating an engaging, brand-consistent Wishlist tile, proving that subtle, thoughtful microinteractions can enhance user engagement without overwhelming the interface.</p>
