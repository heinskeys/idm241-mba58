        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This class project focused on designing an interactive and engaging set of microinteractions to enhance the usability 
            and visual appeal of the Steam Wishlist tile. The goal was to modernize Steam's interface while staying true to its 
            established brand, incorporating subtle interactions to improve the user experience. The final build includes five 
            integrated microinteractions, with detailed descriptions of their triggers, rules, feedback, and loops. These 
            interactions successfully demonstrated my ability to blend thoughtful design with technical execution, resulting in a 
            dynamic and polished redesign.

        <h2>Context and Background</h2>
        <div class="videoStyling">
            <video controls>
                <source src="files/realsteam.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.

        </div>
        <p>
            Over the course of 10 weeks, I worked independently to create a series of microinteractions that would make the Steam 
            Wishlist tile feel more alive and engaging while adhering to Steam's more rigid UI structure. Steam's interface is 
            functional but lacks the visual feedback that can make user interactions more intuitive and satisfying. For example, 
            clicking a button typically results in a simple state change, such as visiting a new page, with no transitional animations 
            or hover effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to design microinteractions that felt seamless and on-brand, enhancing the usability of the Wishlist tile without 
            overwhelming or frustrating users. Steam is an ecommerce platform, so while there was a lot of potential for really cool 
            interactions, I didn’t want them to become cumbersome over time for users. I also wanted to ensure my interactions felt 
            consistent across elements, balancing subtlety with engagement, and I solved technical challenges related to replicating 
            Steam's precise UI styles.

        <h2>Process and Insights</h2>
        <p>
            I started by analyzing Steam’s branding and existing interactions to identify opportunities for improvement. Steam’s 
            audience values straightforward, functional interfaces, so I prioritized microinteractions that would enhance the user 
            experience without disrupting the platform’s simplicity. So, what changes would add visual interest without taking over? 
            How could I integrate some of the interesting interactions and features Steam already has, like its robust rating system 
            and color palette to enhance the Wishlist tile?
        </p>
        <p>
            The project evolved through three stages: Alpha, Beta, and Final builds.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alpha Build:</strong> I primarily focused on replicating Steam’s UI elements and brainstorming initial interaction concepts.</li>
            <li><strong>Beta Build:</strong> Introduced key animations like gradient loops, scaling effects, and tooltip enhancements, refining their implementation with each iteration.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Build:</strong> Polished all interactions, ensuring consistency across elements and solving technical challenges like tooltip clipping and modal alignment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In each build, I worked to make changes feel seamless and well-integrated with one another. A major part of my process was 
            ensuring consistency across all microinteractions. For example, if a button press behaved a certain way on one page, it 
            had to follow the same behavior on another page.

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Ultimately, I added around 5–6 microinteractions that integrated seamlessly into Steam while making the experience feel 
            more dynamic and engaging for users. Here’s a breakdown of some key changes:
        </p>
        <div class="videoStyling">
            <video controls>
                <source src="files/finalbuildvidreal.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Add to Cart Button:</strong> I added an animation where, when users hover over the "Add to Cart" button, a gradient loop plays endlessly until they hover off or press the button. When the button is pressed, it scales up and then down.</li>
            <li><strong>Pop-Up Modal Animation:</strong> Upon pressing the "Add to Cart" button, the modal now flies up instead of simply appearing. Buttons within the modal, like "Continue Shopping" and "Checkout," also feature gradient loops and scaling when clicked.</li>
            <li><strong>Rating Tooltip:</strong> On the Wishlist tile, Steam includes a tooltip explaining the game’s rating (e.g., "Overwhelmingly Positive" or "Overwhelmingly Negative"). I made this tooltip more visually distinct by darkening the background and color-coding the ratings for easier distinction.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Tags:</strong> Steam has a robust tagging system for games, which I wanted to highlight. Now, when users hover over a tag, it pops up, changes color, and features scaling when clicked.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By making these changes, I achieved my goal of seamless integration. These updates don’t drastically change the interface 
            but make it feel more interactive.
